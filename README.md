🗂️ Dataset: Chinook
The Chinook database includes several interrelated tables such as:

1. Customer

2. Invoice

3. InvoiceLine

4. Track

5. Album

6. Artist

7. Genre

8. MediaType

9. Employee

10. Playlist

11. PlaylistTrack

It mimics a real-world digital music store, making it suitable for learning joins, aggregations, subqueries, CTEs and window functions.


📌 Objectives
Practice SQL querying skills using a relational database.

1. Perform business analysis on customer behavior, sales, and product trends.

2. Use joins and subqueries to answer real-world business questions.


🛠️ Tools Used
SQL (Microsoft SQl server)


✅ Key Analyses / Sample Queries
Here are a few examples of the types of analysis performed in this project:

1. 💰 What is the total sales amount by each customer?

2. 🎤 Which artist generated the highest total sales?

3. 🎶 How many tracks are there in each album?

4. 🚫 Which customers have never made a purchase?

5. 🔥 Which genre is the most popular based on total sales?

6. 🧾 What invoices were made by a specific customer?

7. 🧑‍💼 Who are the employees and who are their managers (self-join)?

8. 🏆 Which tracks have been sold the most?

9. 🌍 How many unique customers does each artist have from different countries?

10. Which artists have the most customers from the USA and the United Kingdom?

11. 🌐 What is the most popular genre in each country?

12. ❌ Which tracks have never been purchased?

13. 🛒 How many purchases has each customer made?

14. 💿 Which album is the most popular based on purchase count?

15. 📆 What is the monthly revenue (sales grouped by month)?

16. 👨‍💼 Which employees generated the most sales (top support reps)?

17. 🧑‍💻 Which employees have not contributed to any sales?
